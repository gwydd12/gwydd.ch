<p>
    Hi, I'm Gwydd—a computer science student with a deep interest in cyber security, free software, and the art of tinkering with code. This blog is my space to share my thoughts, projects, and random discoveries. Whether I'm writing exploits, playing with CTFs, or diving into privacy-focused projects, I'll bring my latest explorations here.
    
    Everything you read reflects my personal views, so feel free to engage, debate, or just say hi! Let's explore the world of tech together.</p>
