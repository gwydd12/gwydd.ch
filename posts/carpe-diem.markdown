A preface is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. 
Although, the writing of this blog will never be a book nor can it be categorized as 
literature I think it should have an own preface.

Even though, prefaces are mostly written after the finishing touches of the book 
I'll write this as the first blogpost to publish on this website.
It provides myself with a starting point for this project I've had in mind for 
a couple of years. 
This blog allows me to think deeply about my research, projects, ideas and a lot more, besides that it
allows me to share it with the whole internet. 
The latter part unnerves me quite a bit, it gives myself an imaginary pressure
to present my work with more care and thoroughness. 
Paradoxically this part also excites me due to the reason that I have to think deeply about the work I do. 

This blog will be an aggregation of multiple research interest I pursue.
At the time of writing this blog does not have any particular focus on a subject.
