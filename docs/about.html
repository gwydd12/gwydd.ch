            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I’m a computer science student.
Although my studies keep me busy most of the time, I try to explore different aspects of computer science independently.
When I’m not focused on university work, I dive into the world of cyber security, either writing new exploits
(though I usually don’t find the vulnerabilities myself—probably a skill issue)
or playing CTFs. Outside of cyber security, I tinker with whatever interests me, often in the realm of privacy-focused projects.
However, I prefer not to limit myself to one specific area, as I enjoy exploring various topics.</p>
<p>I’m also an enthusiast about open source development, free software, and privacy.
If you have any questions or cool ideas, I’d love to hear them!</p>
<p>Fun fact: Even though this blog is based on the static website generator hakyll I have no clue how to write any haskell. For me this was
an opportunity to just play around a technology that I probably will not use too often (Atleast for now).</p>
