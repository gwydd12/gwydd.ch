title: About
---
I'm a computer science student. 
Although my studies keep me busy most of the time, I try to explore different aspects of computer science independently. 
When I'm not focused on university work, I dive into the world of cyber security, either writing new exploits 
(though I usually don't find the vulnerabilities myself—probably a skill issue) 
or playing CTFs. Outside of cyber security, I tinker with whatever interests me, often in the realm of privacy-focused projects. 
However, I prefer not to limit myself to one specific area, as I enjoy exploring various topics.

I'm also an enthusiast about open source development, free software, and privacy. 
If you have any questions or cool ideas, I'd love to hear them!
